#### Interoperability. What Is It?
Simply put, it's the ability of information systems to exchange and make use of information or to operate in synchrony with each other.<br> Interoperability can be data level(where data is shared/referenced on other platforms) or semantic level(where data is interpreted by ML systems).

##### Who Can Benefit from Data Interoperability?

- Educators<br>
Data is an integral part of education and needs to be shared efficiently, securely and cost-effectively(i.e. making data reusable).<br> Teachers can use students data ethically to make well informed decisions that helps the students grow in the direction they intend to. Teachers also benefit from interoperability when they focus less energy on creating data already accessible on trusted platforms and more energy on innovation with that data. 

- Human Resource<br>
HR can reduce cost of hiring process by leveraging data interoperability. An example of this is lateral recruitment, where a candidate is poached from a company and hired because they are skilled for the job in question and already doing a similar job. Another example is making use of a candidate's online presence, profile or impact to hire a candidate.<br> The main point here is that if there's proven reference of a candidate's eligibility, human resource can cut costs on interviews and hire candidates based on the trusted data provided. This also saves time which can be nurtured into onboarding etc...

- Healthcare<br>
By storing a patient's medical records, healthcare providers can reuse them as guide to diagnose the patient in future. Also when it comes to diseases, healthcare providers can leverage data interoperability by making use of general trusted information as guide to diagnose a patient.

Interoperability can be used to a maximum advantage in many more industries like transport and safety, manufacturing, software, government, etc. Wherever there is a need for well informed data, interoperability can be leveraged.
