##### Resilience. What is it? <br>
Resilience is the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences, especially through mental, emotional, and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands.

###### is Resilience the point of a human being's existence? <br>

 If it's up to a human being, they can be resilient forever -- because you are capable of being flexible or elastic, you get used to any situation as long as you've been in it for long, and don't even see the next serious situation as unbearable, and it continues forever. Is that all life is about, to build resilience? or to know how to be resilient to be able to live life at an advantage? What life do you live if all you do is learn resilience? When do you live?

Just like resilience, it's beneficial to learn other survival traits that helps us live life at an advantage but never to merely exist for these survival traits. As the name suggests, they are help or skills for benefit not for destruction of purpose!

Take Away? <br>
Be strong or resilient for a purpose.
